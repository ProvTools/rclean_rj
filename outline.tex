\begin{itemize}
\item Background: R has enabled the rapid production of scientific
  software without the imposed restrictions of software best practices
  for concision, clarity or general transparency and reproducibility.
\item Define code cleaning goals
\item Define data provenance and describe how it enables code cleaning
\item Introduce Rclean, basics of API
\item Example: micro.R and/or messycode.R
\item Conclusion: Rclean is just begninning to crack the surface of
  provenance aware tools.
