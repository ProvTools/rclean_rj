\abstract{

R has enabled the rapid production of scientific software without
languistically imposed restrictions of many software best practices
for accessible code. With the goal of making the task of simplifying
scripts easier, we have created the \texttt{Rclean} package, which
uses recent advances in language specific data provenance capture to
enable a user to isolate the essential code, data and dependencies
needed to produce a specific result. As even relatively short scripts
can quickly become computationally complicated and opaque, we predict
that the code simplification method provided by \texttt{Rclean} and
similar tools will have significant impact on the transparency and
reproducibility of R code.

\input{outline.tex}

\section{Section title in sentence case}

Introductory section which may include references in parentheses
\citep{R}, or cite a reference such as \citet{R} in the text.

\section{Another section}

This section may contain a figure such as Figure~\ref{figure:rlogo}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics{Rlogo-5}
  \caption{The logo of R.}
  \label{figure:rlogo}
\end{figure}

\section{Another section}

There will likely be several sections, perhaps including code snippets, such as:

\begin{example}
  x <- 1:10
  result <- myFunction(x)
\end{example}
